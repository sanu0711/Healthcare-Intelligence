## Overview

The aim is to develop a comprehensive system that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques to predict diseases based on user-provided symptoms and manage patient information effectively.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

The following machine learning algorithms were utilized for disease prediction:

- **Decision Tree:** Constructs a tree-like structure to make decisions based on feature values.
- **Random Forest:** Ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and outputs the mode of the classes.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Classifies data points by finding the hyperplane that best separates different classes.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Classifies data points based on the majority class among their k nearest neighbors.
- **Naive Bayes:** Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, assuming independence between features.

## Features

- **Disease Prediction:** Predict diseases based on user-provided symptoms.
- **Patient Report Generation:** Generate detailed patient reports including predicted disease, description, precautions, and medication suggestions.
- **Django Integration:** Implemented using Django framework, incorporating various features such as dynamic input chatbox, voice search, and location integration.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive user interface with interactive features for seamless user experience.

- **AI Health Assistant (ChatBot) : ** The AI Health Assistant provides tailored health guidance and information, harnessing cutting-edge AI models and advanced NLP techniques. Users can explore health tips, uncover causes, symptoms, and precautions, discover home remedies, receive medication guidance, and locate nearby hospitals.
